# Dimensional Traits vs. Personality Types
## Sharing an interactive dataviz showing why cramming the complexity of personality into a few types just doesn‚Äôt work.

For a guest lecture I‚Äôm giving on personality in the business world, I built a simple interactive dataviz that clearly demonstrates just how futile (and a bit na√Øve) it is to try to squeeze the huge variability of personality characteristics into a handful of types like‚Ä¶ [insert your favorite typology üòâ].

The dataviz uses a sample of 10k Big Five profiles from [Johnson‚Äôs IPIP-NEO-300 dataset](https://osf.io/wxvth/files/osfstorage). With a 3D scatter plot, profile line chart, UMAP dimensionality reduction, and the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, it shows that even when groups of people with similar profiles do appear‚Äîand are large enough to matter (say, at least 1% of the population)‚Äîthey still show pretty high within-group variability. On top of that, a big chunk (actually, the majority) of profiles can‚Äôt be assigned to any stable cluster at all, ending up as ‚Äúnoise‚Äù points in HDBSCAN‚Äôs terms.

If you find it useful for your teaching or training, check out the dataviz [here](https://sanofi-people-analytics.shinyapps.io/personality-mapping/). If you want to download the data and code to run it locally, you will find it in this GitHub repo.
